# Execute `main.R` with timer, seed and data storage

Make sure you have the two following environment variables in your `.Renviron` file :

* `FISHMAP_OUTPUT_DIR` : path to the directory to store the model output, it will be created if it does not exist

* `FISHMAP_UPDATE_OUTPUTS` : logical, enable outputs to be saved if sets to `TRUE`

To update your `.Renviron` file, you can run the `usethis::edit_r_environ()` command which will directly open the file in edit mode.


```{r vign-renviron, eval = FALSE}
FISHMAP_OUTPUT_DIR="~/shared/outputs_fishmap"
FISHMAP_UPDATE_OUTPUTS=TRUE
```

To execute `main.R` and store its output, execute the following command.
This script will execute `main.R` with a seed to secure reproducibility, it will report time of execution per step and store the data in the folder specified by the environment variable.


```{r vign-run_main_and_save_output, eval = FALSE}
source(here::here("dev","run_main_and_save_output.R"))
```
